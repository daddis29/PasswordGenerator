## Password Generator 

An employee with access to sensitive data wants to randomly generate a password containing various criteria to create a strong password.


```
When you click the button to generate a password, you are presented with a series of prompts for password criteria.

When you are prompted, you will select which criteria youâ€™d like to include: uppercase, lowercase, special characters and numbers.

When you are prompted for the password, you will be informed it must be between 8-128 characters.

When you choose your responses, all input will be validated as long as one character type is selected.
When all prompts are answered, a password will be generated that matches the criteria. 

When the password is generated, it is displayed in the password text box.
